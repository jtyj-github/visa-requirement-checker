This is a webapp that displays the type of visa a traveler would have to apply for when traveling to a particular country. I created the starting files using nextjs bootstrap create-next-app.

This app was made as a starter project to gain experience in fullstack development - any feedback and advice are welcome!

## ISO-2 Country Codes

In the app, the input fields for 'Passport Country' and 'Destination Country' have to be in the ISO-2 Country Code format

You can check out [ISO-2 reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2/) to learn more about ISO-2 Country Codes

## Future Updates

More updates are scheduled for the future:
- Prettifying the frontend of the app
- Feature to input your passport country only, and retrieve a list of all countries and their visa requirements for travel
